# Opuluxe Jewellery

Welcome to my learning project where I explore the integration of the Context API in React Native with Firebase as the Backend as a Service (BaaS). This project aims to showcase the synergy between state management using the Context API and real-time data storage and retrieval provided by Firebase.
## Tech Stack

**Client:** React-Native

**BaaS:** Firebase


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/blamex321/Opuluxe-jewelry.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Opuluxe-jewelry
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```


## Learning Objectives

- Context API Mastery: Understand the nuances of the Context API in React Native and how it simplifies state management across components.
